Demos showing tree functionality
--------------------------------
See also binaryTree.c/h in the Sorting Demos 

Makefile - Makefile for demos in this directory

abstractQueue.h - Header file for basic queue operations, needed for level order traversal

directoryTree.c - Demo program showing how to build a tree with an arbitrarily large number of children at each node. Prints all the files in a specified directory subtree, then allows search by filename.

filesearch.c - Part of directoryTree demo, finds all the files in a subdirectory. Probably will work on Linux only.

filesearch.h - Declaration of public functions in filesearch.c

linkedListQueue.c - Implementation of abstract queue, used in tree level order traversal

simpleBinaryTree.c - Simple tree built in level order

simpleBinaryTree.h - Declaration of public functions in simpleBinaryTree.c

simpleTreeTester.c - Driver to explore/exercise functions in simpleBinaryTree.c
