/** 
 *  linkedListUtil.h
 *
 *  Header file for utility linked list module
 *  Used to create and manage lists that are part of other data
 *    structures.
 *
 *  Each call to newList() creates a new list and returns the pointer
 *  to that list. So by calling newList() multiple times, the calling
 *  program can create and manage many linked lists.
 *
 *  The list can hold any kind of data, via a void* pointer. It assumes
 *  that the calling program will manage the memory for that data,
 *  so it does not free it.
