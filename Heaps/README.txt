Demo programs related to heaps
------------------------------

Makefile  - Linux make file for programs in this directory

abstractHeap.h - Defines an interface for a general min or max priority heap (selectable)

arrayHeap.c - Implements the abstractHeap interface using an array

heapTester.c - Driver program for testing and exploring the heap ADT

treeHeapTester.c - Demonstration program that implements a min heap of integers using an actual partially sorted binary tree. Shows how complicated this is compared to an array implementation.
